= Summary

You've learned today how quickly Java developers can create cloud-native microservice project using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/). Then, the applications were deployed to serverless functions to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) with `JVM` and `Native` mode with the key benefits of Quarkus as below:

* Move as much as possible to build phase
* Minimize runtime dependencies
* Maximize dead code elimination
* Introduce clear metadata contracts
* Enhance developer joy

The Quarkus native compilation allows you to have high resource density as almost same as https://go.dev[Go programming language^] on the Kubernetes clusters.

Quarkus funqy also provides the other extensions for you to deploy the serverless functions to` Azure Function` and `Google Cloud Platform`.
